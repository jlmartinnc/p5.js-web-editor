# [p5.js Editor](https://editor.p5js.org)

## Welcome! 👋👋🏿👋🏽👋🏻👋🏾👋🏼

The p5.js Editor is a website for creating p5.js sketches, with a focus on making coding accessible and inclusive for artists, designers, educators, beginners, and anyone else! You can create, share, or remix p5.js sketches without needing to download or configure anything. It is designed with beginners in mind, limiting features and frills. The editor is free and open-source because we believe software, and the tools to learn it, should be accessible to everyone.

## Community 🌱 🌸

We are a community of, and in solidarity with, people from every gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, race, ethnicity, language, neuro-type, size, ability, class, religion, culture, subculture, political opinion, age, skill level, occupation, and background. We acknowledge that not everyone has the time, financial means, or capacity to actively participate, but we recognize and encourage involvement of all kinds. We facilitate and foster access and empowerment. We are all learners.

> **TypeScript Migration:** 
> As of July 2025, we are working on migrating the repo to TypeScript as part of the **[p5.js Web Editor pr05 Grant](https://github.com/processing/pr05-grant/wiki/2025-pr05-Program-Page)**.  
> This migration will occur in two phases:
> 1. **Grant Work (July – October 31, 2025)** – Setting up TypeScript configuration, tooling, and starting partial migration. Contributions will be **closed** during this period.
> 2. **Open Contribution (After October 31, 2025)** – TypeScript migration tasks will **open** to all contributors, with guidelines and tutorials available.  
>
> For full details, see [TypeScript Migration Plan](./contributor_docs/typescript-migration.md).
