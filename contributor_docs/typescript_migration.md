# TypeScript Migration

This repository is undergoing a TypeScript migration as part of the **2025 pr05 Grant: Incremental Typescript Migration of the p5.js Web Editor**, running **July – October 31, 2025**. Details on the [pr05 grant](https://github.com/processing/pr05-grant/wiki/2025-pr05-Program-Page) and [migration project](https://github.com/processing/pr05-grant/wiki/2025-pr05-Project-List#incremental-typescript-migration-for-the-p5js-editor).

## Phase 1: Grant Work (July – October 31, 2025)

During this period, the grant team will:

- Configure and enable TypeScript across the project (`tsconfig`, linting, type checking, etc).
- Set up linting, testing, and other related developer tooling for TS.
- Begin migrating selected JavaScript files to TypeScript.
- Prepare documentation and workflow so migration tasks can become **good first issues** for new contributors.

> **Note:** While this initial setup and partial migration is in progress, contributions to the migration itself will **not** be open to the public.

## Phase 2: Open Contribution (After October 31, 2025)

When the grant period ends:

- The migration effort will open up to all contributors.
- This section will include **guidelines, tutorials, and examples** for migrating files from JavaScript to TypeScript in this project.
- Migration tasks will be clearly labeled in the issue tracker (e.g., `good first issue`, `typescript migration`).
