## Project Outline:

### Project Context:

<details open>
  <summary>View details</summary>

- Grant period of 200h over July 1st - October 31, 2025
- 116k lines of code within the repo, with about 30% test coverage
- Many older technologies, tied to Node 16 (bumped to Node 18 in August)

</details>

### Proposed Approach:

> To set up the repo so that beginning contributors can pick up migration work as a "Good first issue"

<details>
  <summary>Set up all config to be both TS & JS compatible</summary>

- Not possible to migrate entire repo within 200h
- Migration must also be file-by-file, so all config needs to be flexible to work with legacy JS code
- Key technologies:
  - Node
  - React
  - Express
  - MongoDB
  - Jest
  - Babel
  - Webpack
  - ESLint

</details>

<details>
  <summary>Set up typechecking tooling & automation
  </summary>

- Global typecheck command for both the `/server` and `/client` folders
- Isolated typecheck command for each the `/server` and `/client` folders
- Automated typecheck on pre-commit hook
- Automated typecheck on CICD tests

</details>

<details>
  <summary>
    Migrate an instance of each "kind" of file a developer might encounter to provide example code to follow
  </summary>

- Client:
  - React file
  - Plain TS file (eg. `/utils`)
- Server:
  - Mongoose Model --> `User`
  - Mongoose Controller --> `User.Controller`
  - Express Routes
  - Plain TS file (eg. `/utils`)
- Examples of writing tests for the above
- Example of extending namespaced types through `.d.ts` files

</details>

## Key Decisions:

<details>
  <summary>
    Typescript is configured to be used for type checking only, not for transpiling
  </summary>

```shell
npm run tsc --noEmit
```

- The repo is too large to convert entirely to TS in one go, so we need to flexibly support both TS and JS files
- We have existing legacy runtime build tools (Babel & Webpack) for the existing JS, so this was the easiest way to support both our intended direction and legacy codebase
- Our configured automated type checking prevents PRs from being merged if they fail, so we're working towards a Typescript system without disrupting current build.
- Once the repo has been migrated, we can update to full transpilation with `npm run tsc`

</details>

<details>
  <summary>
    Prefer `named` exports over `default` exports where possible
  </summary>

❌ DON'T:

```ts
// calculator.ts
export default function multiply(a: number, b: number): numer {
  return a * b;
}

// main.ts
import calculate from './calculator'; // the default function is renamed and confusing for next dev to read

console.log(calculate(2, 2)); // is this 2*2? 2+2? 2^2? something else?
```

✅ DO:

```ts
// calculator.ts
export function multiply(a: number, b: number): numer {
  return a * b;
}

// main.ts
import { multiply } from './calculator';

console.log(multiply(2, 2));
```

- Default exports allow devs to rename the import anything they want, and inaccurate misnaming will cause confusion
- Renaming default export also makes it more difficult to perform a global search on the function

</details>

<details>
  <summary>
  Prefer `interface` over `type`
  </summary>

```tsx
// ✅ interface
interface ButtonProps {
  label: string
  disabled?: boolean
  onClick: () => void
}
const Button = ({ label, disabled, onClick }: ButtonProps) => (...)

// ❌ type
type ButtonProps = {
  label: string
  disabled?: boolean
  onClick: () => void
}

// ✅ keep type for primitives
type UserId = string;
```

- Clearer semantic meaning when describing structured objects vs. primitives
- This is not strictly enforced in linting rules, but aims to align with [Google Typescript styling](https://google.github.io/styleguide/tsguide.html#prefer-interfaces). Please see attached link for details.

</details>

<br>

<details>
  <summary>
  If possible, add unit tests prior to the component that you are migrating prior to performing any migration
  </summary>

- This protects the app from unintended regression & also helps demonstrate to reviewers that you understand the intent of a component/file you are migrating
- Tests also help document how the component is intended to work.
- Please see [testing](../testing.md) for more details on general guidelines, or the example code index below.

</details>

<details>
  <summary>
    If a component does not have an existing unit test, keep refactors/logic changes outside of Typescript Migration PRs
  </summary

- This helps keep reviews easy for maintainers
- Branch off the migration PR and make a subsequent PR with your proposed refactor.

</details>

<br>

<details>
  <summary>
    Add JSDocs & specify the `Express` `RequestHandler` generics to `/server` controller methods in the following example:
  </summary>

```ts
// see server/controllers/user.controller/userPreferences.ts

/**
 * - Method: `PUT`
 * - Endpoint: `/preferences`
 * - Authenticated: `true`
 * - Id: `UserController.updatePreferences`
 *
 * Description:
 *   - Update user preferences, such as AppTheme
 */
export const updatePreferences: RequestHandler<
  {}, // request params type if there are any, extending RouteParam
  UpdatePreferencesResponseBody, // response body type
  UpdatePreferencesRequestBody // request body type
  // query params type if there are any
> = async (req, res) => {
  // ... rest of code
};
```

- JSDocs will reduce cognitive load for other developers and enable them to see the controllers details on hover.
- Add the JSDocs to any `client` controllers that use these endpoints.

<details>
  <summary>
  Best-effort & evolving-precision principle towards defining types
  </summary>

- Because we are adding types into a legacy project originally written without types, there are sometimes inconsistencies between component contracts, or misalignments between type shapes or name conventions that make adding in types difficult.
- As such make a best effort at being as precise as possible with context clues, but when in doubt, selecting a broader type (eg. `string` instead of an `enum`) is valid and we can update to be stricter as the migration continues.

</details>

<br>

<details>
  <summary>
    `/server` types live in `/server/types`. `/client` types are co-located (currently). Shared types between the `/server` and `/client` live in `/common/types`.  
  </summary>

- `/server` types are in `/types` folder
  - These types should serves the source-of-truth for the rest of the app.
- Pull any types that are relevant to share with the `./client` into the `./common/types` folder
- `/client` types are co-located for now
  - Components have their own types so they will get very numerous and messy
  - However this is open to proposals for change

  - [types/index](https://github.com/processing/p5.js-web-editor/blob/develop/common/types/index.ts)
    - Note that for some APIs (eg. user) we don't want to export **all** types, we want to specifically name the types to share with the client (eg. not `UserDocument`)

</details>

## Next Step Issues:

<details>
  <summary>Migrate the rest of the repo to Typescript</summary>

- [Issue Link - TODO]()

- Prioritise `/server` if possible
- Testing is mandatory for `/server` migration
- For `/client` files, if the component does not hit the `/server` api, it is ready for migration.
- If it does it is recommended to wait for the relevant `/server` system to be migrated first (eg. Projects, Collections)

</details>

<details>
  <summary>Add end-to-end tests to cover the core user flows</summary>

- [Issue Link - TODO]()

- Writing a suite of e2e tests to cover core user flows would enable security against regression with fewer test files necessary
- This can be done with Playwrite or Cypress & can be integrated into CICD pipelines.
- Examples of core user flows include:
  - `User can log in`
  - `User can save a sketch & see it in their sketches`
- To be discussed further with the contributor community.

</details>

<details>
  <summary>Create a OpenAPI/Swagger documentation microsite for the server APIs</summary>

<img src='./images/swagger-microsite.png' alt='proof of concept of a swagger documentation microsite'>

- [Swagger.ui](https://swagger.io/tools/swagger-ui/)
- [Issue Link - TODO]()

- This would enable new contributors to have a centralised location to look for APIs
- Also aligns with current API documentation standards as of 2025
- Current API documentation lives [here](https://github.com/processing/p5.js-web-editor/blob/develop/contributor_docs/public_api.md) and does not contain all the APIs
- [Proof of concept PR here](https://github.com/processing/p5.js-web-editor/pull/3706)
  - I have written out the User related APIs by hand, but ideally we would have automation to check that this document is accurate, or to autogenerate the document, or autogenerate types & routes from the document.
